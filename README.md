## 🏆 Notable Projects

### Imperative programming ***[View Project](S5/PIM/Projet)***
- This project involved implementing, evaluating, and comparing different methods for storing and exploiting a router's routing table. The focus was on improving efficiency through caching mechanisms and exploring various cache management policies.

### Signal Processing ***[View Project](S5/TdS/Projet)***
- This project focused on the realization of a modem according to the V21 recommendation of the ITU. It involved studying frequency modulation, signal generation, and demodulation techniques, including handling perturbations and using filters for signal recovery.

### Networking ***[View Project](S6/Reseau/Projet)***
- This project covered the basics of networking, including understanding routers, IP addresses, web servers, and DNS servers. It provided foundational knowledge for network configuration and management.

### Centralized Operating Systems ***[View Project](S6/SEC/Projet)***
- The goal of this project was to develop a simplified command interpreter with basic Unix shell functionalities. It involved managing processes, signals, and I/O operations, and progressively adding features like job control and signal handling.

### Telecommunications ***[View Project](S6/Telecom/Projet)***
- This project explored the impact of a frequency-selective propagation channel and equalization methods. It involved studying transmission over carrier frequencies, implementing modulation schemes, and analyzing the effects of multi-path propagation.

### Object Technology ***[View Project](https://github.com/c-l-e-m-e-n-t/SimulateurDeFoule)***
- Java-based simulation of a crowd. It allows for the simulation of various scenarios and visualization of results through a graphical interface.
